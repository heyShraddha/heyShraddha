Goal: 

Given an API endpoint as per Open API standard, an upper limit of data size of 263 MB to be sent in one request and minimum data size as 0,
if someone follows my approach, they would achieve

1. Maxmimum Serialization and Deserialization latency of XML, YAML, JSON.


To Test: 
Someone would test it by maximum data size.

Extremes:
1. Behave when key is big, value is small.
2. Behave when value is big, key is small.


// Comeback with a flow chart - in the end
Relative terms from one data exchange format to another. 

Algorithm 
Current and deserialization -
o(n2)
o(n log n)

Contribution : New kind of serialization and deserialization technique/ flow chart
Which one to recommend? 
Whatever you have chosen, minimum serialization and deserialization


Why is something red, why is something green. - Come up with an algorithm that at least increase 0.1 % at any part of conditions.

10min ppt, 10min demo, projector is your responsibility, 10 min Q and A. 30 minutes is upper limit.

Add sections - can't delete -  reduce from template. < FOLLOW TEMPLATE >
Plagarism checks - do not put images - all your diagrams should be numbered. DO NOT HAVE IMAGES < HAVE DIAGRAMS NUMBERED >
Plagarism score - really want to put a definition of anything... like what is HTTP 1.0? < WHAT ALREADY KNOWN IS NOT REQUIRED, MENTION IN APPENDIX IF NECESSARY >
