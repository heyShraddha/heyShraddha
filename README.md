Since the time I was a child, programming improvement has been my obsession. I actually recall sitting before PC and running QBASIC commands to move cursor left and right. It was much the same as a sorcery, being capable to get the PC to do whatever I needed. Throughout middle and high-school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to dozen of projects I tried implementing through C and Java.

This enthusiasm helped me through my bachelors in Christ (Deemed to be University) Bangalore, India. Also, it was here I genuinely figured out how much there was at this point to learn.
Thus, presently, in industry and my masters in BITS PILANI, the passion stays with me. There's surely yet more to learn and issues to tackle and yet to build. 
And for this, I am grateful. :P
